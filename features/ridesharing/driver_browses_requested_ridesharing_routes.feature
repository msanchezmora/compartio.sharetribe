Feature: Driver browses requested car pooling routes
  In order to to help others and/or get some gas money with a car ride I'm going to do anyway
  As a driver planning a car ride soon
  I want to browse ridesharing requests to see if someone needs to travel the same way

  # Commented out as requires sphinx and that caused some problems in test
  # that we didn't fix now as we might soon change the search engine
  # @javascript
  # Scenario: Browsing all ridesharing requests
  #   Given there are following users:
  #     | person |
  #     | kassi_testperson1 |
  #     | kassi_testperson2 |
  #   And there is rideshare request from "tkk" to "kamppi" by "kassi_testperson1"
  #   And there is rideshare request from "Oulu" to "Helsinki" by "kassi_testperson2"
  #   And there is item offer with title "axe" from "kassi_testperson2" and with share type "lend"
  #   And I am on the home page
  #   When I select "Rideshare" from "listing_category"
  #   Then I should see "tkk - kamppi"
  #   And I should see "Oulu - Helsinki"
  #   But I should not see "axe"
