Boulder Flood Relief has the right, but not the obligation, to regulate content (which includes but is not limited to postings, text, code, images, video, binary files, ads, accounts, account information, flags, emails, messages and any other user communications ("content")) posted to, stored on or transmitted via the Services by any user (or any other third party in any manner); to regulate conduct (including but not limited to any authorized or unauthorized access to or use of the Services) by any user (or any other third party in any manner); and to enforce the TOU, for any reason and in any manner or by any means that Boulder Flood Relief, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate (including but not limited to automated and manual screening, blocking, filtering, exclusion from index pages, exclusion from search results, requiring the use of an application programming interface (API), requiring the use of a bulk posting interface, authorization, verification, and the deletion and/or termination of content, accounts and/or all or any use or access). Boulder Flood Relief may, in its sole discretion and without notice, start, stop or modify any regulation or enforcement measures at any time. Boulder Flood Relief action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of the TOU by any user (or any other third party) does not waive Boulder Flood Relief's right to implement or not implement regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential TOU violation.

You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by Boulder Flood Relief or any of its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, "Boulder Flood Relief Representatives") to prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential TOU violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither Boulder Flood Relief nor any Boulder Flood Relief Representative shall be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict, redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential violation of the TOU.

Although Boulder Flood Relief Representatives may moderate content, conduct and TOU compliance on the Services at Boulder Flood Relief's discretion, Boulder Flood Relief Representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to anyone that they or anyone else on behalf of Boulder Flood Relief will "take care" of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or anyone else on behalf of Boulder Flood Relief will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported TOU violation from occurring or recurring. Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by any Boulder Flood Relief Representative (or by anyone else acting on behalf of Boulder Flood Relief or by anyone purportedly acting on behalf of Boulder Flood Relief) that Boulder Flood Relief (including but not limited to any Boulder Flood Relief Representative, anyone else acting on behalf of Boulder Flood Relief, or anyone purportedly acting on behalf of Boulder Flood Relief) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that Boulder Flood Relief, Boulder Flood Relief Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of Boulder Flood Relief shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that Boulder Flood Relief, a Boulder Flood Relief Representative or anyone else on behalf of Boulder Flood Relief would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation. This paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by Boulder Flood Relief's Chief Executive Officer and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is granted.
Boulder Flood Relief also has the right in its sole discretion to limit, modify, interrupt, suspend or discontinue all or any portions of the Services at any time without notice.
