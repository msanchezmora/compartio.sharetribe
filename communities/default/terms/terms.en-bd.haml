%p
  Boulevard-21 shall not be held responsible for the content published by the User, should it be in the Ads posted or withing the messages sent via its messaging system, nor should it be concerned by any litigation that might occur between its Users. In particular:
%p
  It is recalled that the Landlord remains the sole decision-maker when it comes to contracting with a candidate. Hence, the User shall not consider the user of the Site’s services as guarantee to see his application accepted by another User, the latter being either a tenant, a flatmate, a subtenant, or the landlord. Reciprocally, a User that has published an ad and contracted with another User, shall not consider Boulevard-21 responsible for any conflict occuring before, during, or after the contract life.
%p
  For that matter, it is especially recalled that the Users are supposed to comply with the housing regulation applicable in the country of the ad promoted. In France, in the case of a subletting of a non-furnished place, the main tenant is bound to have a written consent from the landlord before subletting his place. Should he fail to meet this obligation, the landlord is entitled to renege the lease and ask for compensation. In case where he succeeds to have the consent from the landlord, the amount of the subrent, expressed in euros per square meter, shall not exceed the main rent.
%p
  Boulevard-21 thrives to produce, publish, or curate reliable, accurate, and relevant content. However, Boulevard-21 shall not be held responsible for any error and the consequences that might arise from this error, should it be in its own pieces of content or in the pieces of content from third parties shared by Boulevard-21.
