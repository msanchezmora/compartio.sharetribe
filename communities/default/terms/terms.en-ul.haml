  2. MODERATION
%p 
  UBR has the right, but not the obligation, to regulate content (which includes but is not limited to postings, text, code, images, video, binary files, ads, accounts, account information, flags, emails, messages and any other user communications (&quot;content&quot;)) posted to, stored on or transmitted via the Services by any user (or any other third party in any manner); to regulate conduct (including but not limited to any authorized or unauthorized access to or use of the Services) by any user (or any other third party in any manner); and to enforce the TOU, for any reason and in any manner or by any means that UBR, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate (including but not limited to automated and manual screening, blocking, filtering, exclusion from index pages, exclusion from search results, requiring the use of an application programming interface (API), requiring the use of a bulk posting interface, authorization, verification, and the deletion and/or termination of content, accounts and/or all or any use or access). UBR may, in its sole discretion and without notice, start, stop or modify any regulation or enforcement measures at any time. UBR action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of the TOU by any user (or any other third party) does not waive UBR's right to implement or not implement regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential TOU violation.
%p 
  You also understand and agree that any action or inaction by UBR or any of its directors, officers, stockholders, employees, consultants, agents or representatives (collectively, &quot;UBR Representatives&quot;) to prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential TOU violation is undertaken voluntarily and in good faith, and you expressly agree that neither UBR nor any UBR Representative shall be liable to you or anyone else for any action or inaction to prevent, restrict, redress, or regulate content, or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential violation of the TOU.
%p 
  Although UBR Representatives may moderate content, conduct and TOU compliance on the Services at UBR's discretion, UBR Representatives have no authority to make binding commitments, promises or representations to anyone that they or anyone else on behalf of UBR will &quot;take care&quot; of any alleged problem or complaint, or that they or anyone else on behalf of UBR will otherwise stop, cure or prevent any problem, content, conduct or purported TOU violation from occurring or recurring. Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by any UBR Representative (or by anyone else acting on behalf of UBR or by anyone purportedly acting on behalf of UBR) that UBR (including but not limited to any UBR Representative, anyone else acting on behalf of UBR, or anyone purportedly acting on behalf of UBR) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that UBR, UBR Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of UBR shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that UBR, a UBR Representative or anyone else on behalf of UBR would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation. This paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by UBR's Chief Executive Officer and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is granted.
%p UBR also has the right in its sole discretion to limit, modify, interrupt, suspend or discontinue all or any portions of the Services at any time without notice. UBR and UBR Representatives shall not be liable for any such limitations, modifications, interruptions, suspensions or discontinuance, or any purported losses, harm or damages arising from or related thereto.
